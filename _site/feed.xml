        <title>Concerning the Quest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to first post of &lt;a href=&quot;http://desiretoinquire.com&quot;&gt;Desire to Inquire&lt;/a&gt;, a blog about my personal quest to become a (more) self-directed learner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month ago, I made the rather big decision (for me at least) to quit my masters program. This blog is meant to act as a sounding board and think tank as I embark on a new but life-long journey to become a wholy self-educated person. I’m hoping to learn a lot as I share and swap insights with my readers. In the end, I wish to provide encourgement and resources to those who are interested in making the most of their learning efforts through self-motivated questioning and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the posts I plan to publish in the coming weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More details of why I quit my masters (aka my philosophy of learning)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The meaning of “desire to inquire” and the importances of inquiring to learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The inspirational people in my life–my mentors, teachers, and examples &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web designer, and the architect of this site design, I also plan to enhance the look and funcionality of this site over time. Some things to come:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some really cool, meaningful logo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An “About” page with more info on me and the history of the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More images and possibly some more texture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to comment on posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for joining me! Stay turned for weekly posts and free free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://desiretoinquire.com/feed.xml&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; if you’re a RSSer!&lt;/p&gt;
