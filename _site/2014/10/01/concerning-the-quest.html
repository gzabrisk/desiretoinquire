	<h1>Concerning the Quest</h1>
	<p class="date">October 01, 2014</p>
	<p>Welcome to first post of <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com">Desire to Inquire</a>, a blog about my personal quest to become a (more) self-directed learner.</p>

<p>One month ago, I made the rather big decision (for me at least) to quit my masters program. This blog is meant to act as a sounding board and think tank as I embark on a new but life-long journey to become a wholy self-educated person. I’m hoping to learn a lot as I share and swap insights with my readers. In the end, I wish to provide encourgement and resources to those who are interested in making the most of their learning efforts through self-motivated questioning and research.</p>

<p>Here are some of the posts I plan to publish in the coming weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More details of why I quit my masters (aka my philosophy of learning)</li>
  <li>The meaning of “desire to inquire” and the importance of inquiring to learning</li>
  <li>The inspirational people in my life–my mentors, teachers, and examples </li>
</ul>

<p>As a web designer, and the architect of this site design, I also plan to enhance the look and funcionality of this site over time. Some things to come:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some really cool, meaningful logo</li>
  <li>An “About” page with more info on me and the history of the site</li>
  <li>More images and possibly some more texture</li>
  <li>The ability to comment on posts</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for joining me! Stay turned for weekly posts and free free to <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a> if you’re a RSSer!</p>
