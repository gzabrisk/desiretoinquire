	<p class="date">October 01, 2014</p>
	<p>One month ago, I made the rather big decision (at least for me) to quit my masters program and embark on a new but life-long quest to become a wholy self-educated person. Though this blog, I plan to document what I’m learning about self-directed learning. I look forward to sharing and swapping insights with you and hope to become resource to those who may be on this journey with me.</p>

<p>Here are some of the posts I plan to publish in the coming weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More details of why I quit my masters (aka my philosophy of learning)</li>
  <li>The meaning of “desire to inquire” and the importance of inquiring to learning</li>
  <li>The inspirational people in my life–my mentors, teachers, and examples </li>
</ul>

<p>As a web designer and the architect of this site design, I also plan to enhance the look and functionality of this site over time. Some things to come:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some really cool, meaningful logo</li>
  <li>An “About” page with background info </li>
  <li>More images and possibly some texture to add character</li>
  <li>The ability to comment on posts</li>
  <li>Categories for organization once I have a more than a few posts</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for joining me! Stay turned for weekly posts and please <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a> (if that’s your thing).</p>
