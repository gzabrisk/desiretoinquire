title: Concerning the Quest 
---
Welcome to the first post of <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com">Desire to Inquire</a>, a blog about my personal quest to become a (more) self-directed learner.

One month ago, I made the rather big decision (for me at least) to quit my masters program. This blog is meant to act as a sounding board and journal as I embark on a new but life-long journey to become a wholy self-educated person. I'm look forward to sharing and swapping insights with my readers and providing encourgement and resources to those who are interested in making the most of their learning through self-motivated questioning and research.

Here are some of the posts I plan to publish in the coming weeks:

- More details of why I quit my masters (aka my philosophy of learning)
- The meaning of "desire to inquire" and the importance of inquiring to learning
- The inspirational people in my lifeâ€“my mentors, teachers, and examples 

As a web designer and the architect of this site design, I also plan to enhance the look and functionality of this site over time. Some things to come:

- Some really cool, meaningful logo
- An "About" page with background info 
- More images and possibly some texture to add character
- The ability to comment on posts
- Categories for organization once I have a more than a few posts

Thanks for joining me! Stay turned for weekly posts and please <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a> (if that's your thing).
