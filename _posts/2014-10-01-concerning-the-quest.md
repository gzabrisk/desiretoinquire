title: Concerning the Quest 
---
One month ago, I made the rather big decision (at least for me) to quit my masters program and embark on a new but life-long quest to become a wholy self-educated person. Though this blog, I plan to document what I'm learning about self-directed learning. I look forward to sharing and swapping insights with you and hope to become resource to those who may be on this journey with me.

Here are some of the posts I plan to publish in the coming weeks:

- More details of why I quit my masters (aka my philosophy of learning)
- The meaning of "desire to inquire" and the importance of inquiring to learning
- The inspirational people in my lifeâ€“my mentors, teachers, and examples 

As a web designer and the architect of this site design, I also plan to enhance the look and functionality of this site over time. Some things to come:

- Some really cool, meaningful logo
- An "About" page with background info 
- More images and possibly some texture to add character
- The ability to comment on posts
- Categories for organization once I have a more than a few posts

Thanks for joining me! Stay turned for weekly posts and please <a href="http://desiretoinquire.com/feed.xml">subscribe</a> (if that's your thing).
